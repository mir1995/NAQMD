# Non-Adiabatic Quantum Molecular Dynamics 

We are interested in the dynamics of molecules beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. 

### The methods available allow to approximate the solution of quantum observables corresponding to the solution of the following coupled system of TDSEs:

```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```
