    "### Abstract (Message of the paper)\n",
    "\n",
    "A novel transition probability rate that accounts for non-adiabatic transitions between energy levels is presented. We incorporate this Superadiabatic rate within the Probabilistic Single Switch Surface Hopping algortithm of Lasser et al. We compare the quality of the resulting algorithm to one using the more famous Landau-Zener rate. \n",
    "Whilst the latter gives accurate results for many systems, it deteriorates significantly in regimes such as where the energy gap is relatively large. We demonstrate the greater performance of the Superadiabatic rate in these regimes on model system and the NaI and Pyrazine. The Superadiabatic rate achieves higher orders of accuracy for the final non-adiabatic population for the same computational cost.\n",

    "**Reduces to the LZ rate in the small gap regime and zero gradient in the orthogonal direction (multidimensional systems)**|\n"

    "1. **Big picture motivation - Adam**\n",
    "(Why is the work we are doing important for Science?) Do we need a motivation along the lines of: photo-chemical processes in Nature -> scientific method -> exploitation. How a better understanding of these processes would lead to techonological advancement.\n",

    "b) how this superadiabatic formula can actually be introduced into these one-level wavepacket based methods \n",
    "\n",
    "The main is message is that there are numerous methods to solve the one level dynamics efficiently, it is more of a challenge to extend these approaches to account for quantum-effects: tunneling, non-adiabatic transitons, phase-interference effects. (this should perhaps go right after you have introduced the BOA)\n",

    "**Generally speaking the challenge is how to account for quantum effects in these one level wavepacket based methods. We focus on non-adiabatic effects.**"
